            <p class="card-text">Since I got excellent grades for my calculus classes at WCC, my math instructor Johnny Hu advised me to apply for the math tutor in learning center, and he wrote the recommendation letter for me. At the same time, our ESL program for international students need one students to tutor after classes, so they invited me to be a tutor for their program because I passed all my ESL courses just in one quarter and got “A” grades for both of my college English writing courses. They believed I had strong language skills. I was admitted to be a tutor in September 2014, and I worked until I graduated. Basically, my job was helping people who come to the learning center solve their problems. On the other hand, I decided to chooses Mathematics as my major because of this job.

My roommate Linda asked me if we could apply for dining service together, and both of us started work after we submitted our application in one week. I worked at the UMN Coffman Panda Express, which was a Chinese fast food restaurant.

            <p class="card-text">I got my job as a grader after one year I enrolled in UCSB, and I only worked for one quarter because I graduated. Before Fall 2018, I received an email from my major advisor Danielle, and she was looking for a grader for both Math124A and Math124B, which was Fourier Series and Numerical Methods and Partial Differential Equations. She knew I took both of these two classes in Summer quarter and got grade “A”, so she advised to apply this job. The professors gave me the answer of assignments or exams, and I gave marks based on their steps of work. During this process, I also felt myself improved a lot.
